# üíß Rainmeter: S.A.S MusicPlayer üéµ

### A simple, highly customizable music player that you can adjust and fine-tune to suit your desktop needs.

Currently comes with 2 types of alignment (Left & Center) and a separate cover art, each having NowPlaying & [WebNowPlaying](https://github.com/tjhrulz/WebNowPlaying) variants.

Each part of the player (title, artist, bar, etc.) can be customized to your preferences _(up to a certain extent)_.

The skin can be edited through the settings UI, which can be opened with middle mouse click on the player or cover art (recommended), or through the context menu.

For advanced usage, the variables file can be accessed through the context menu as well. All variables are labeled into small groups/sections + comments to guide users on what each setting does.
